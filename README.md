# Live Translator

This is a Flutter project that serves as a real-time voice translator from Indonesian to English.

## Features

- Real-time speech-to-text transcription.
- Translation from Indonesian to English using the Gemini AI.

## How it Works

1.  The user taps the microphone button to start speaking.
2.  The application captures the user's voice and converts it into Indonesian text using the `speech_to_text` package.
3.  The transcribed text is then sent to the Gemini AI for translation.
4.  The translated English text is displayed on the screen.
